An extremely basic na√Øve implementation of discourse single sign on

Lots of info gleaned from: https://meta.discourse.org/t/official-single-sign-on-for-discourse-sso/13045

With lots of help from: https://github.com/soulshake/flask-discourse-sso/blob/flask-discourse-sso/www/counter.py

I really like [Miserlou/Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa) for a quick and easy way to deploy a flask app like this.
